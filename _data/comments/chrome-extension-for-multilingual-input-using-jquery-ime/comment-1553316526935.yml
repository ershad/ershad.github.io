message: "I would add three adds into the most useful:\r\n1) Like everyone said an Ad Blocker, I like ABP only because it was the first one I've used and never run into any issue.\r\n2) Disconnect, it will block any Analytics, Advertisement, or Social features within a webpage.\r\n3) I would change Pocket for Google Keep. My logic behind it, is if people are using chrome, they probably are using a google account. Google Keep is a note keeping, tracking and filtering made by Google. It can be accessed via Web, Android or iPhone and with the extension all it takes is a click and it will add your page as a note into it."
