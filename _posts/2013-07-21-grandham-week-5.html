<p>Last week, I implemented different parts of the application including the basics of user authorization. Also did a work on refactoring the code base, our tests are clean now.</p>
<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p>We now have a page to display information of a specific book, which can be navigated from the books list. This page will eventually contain all the information, including location information and links to download the entire MARC data.</p>
<p>User authorization has been added to Grandham using the gem 'devise'. Devise provides beautiful forms required for various user-authorization needs, I customized them to work with the look and feel for Grandham. Some of them are here:</p>

<p>(Social login needs to be implemented in coming weeks)</p>
<p>Our test suite was starting to clutter and due to a problem in <em>factories</em> the <a href="http://travis-ci.org/smc/grandham" target="_blank">CI</a> has been failing randomly. I've refactored the test suite and now it all works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous </strong></p>
<p>In other news, we have switched the browser to run tests from selenium - firefox to <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist" target="_blank">poltergeist</a> - <a href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank">phantomjs</a>. It helps us to run tests faster. Also I've updated our API and data import script.</p>
