<p>Last week I've been working on admin review feature to incorporate the new changes happened in the user end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ershadk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-1.56.09-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-754" alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-26 at 1.56.09 AM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-1.56.09-AM-1024x290.png" width="625" height="177" /></a></p>
<p>With the addition of in-place editing feature, admins can now approve minor edits by actually looking the difference. They also have options to replace author/publisher if the previously set author was different.</p>
<p>Along with that, we now have an option to upload book cover. It can be found in 'Add new book' form. In the long run, it will be also appearing under each book cover(in book page) where user can upload a cover just like they edit other information.</p>
