<p>It's always wonderful to play with terminal. Last week, I tried to configure my Gmail account in mutt, a powerful console based mail client, using <a href="http://www.andrews-corner.org/mutt.html">this</a> tutorial. I had to create some configuration files for various related applications and executed some commands. Hence I thought it would be nice if there is any script/program to configure mutt easily by simply entering the Gmail ID and password. Here is such an application, written in C++, which will help you to configure mutt very easily. All that you need to do is install mutt and follow these steps :</p>
<p>1. Download <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?jz5drhuqw4l">this</a> file<br />
2. Exctract it to your home directory<br />
3. Execute the following commands :</p>
<blockquote><p>$cd muttgconf<br />
$./muttgconf</p></blockquote>
<p>VERY IMPORTANT: THE PROGRAM CREATES / MODIFIES MANY CONFIGURATION FILES. I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS CAUSED BY THIS APPLICATION. USE IT UNDER YOUR RISK.</p>
<p>Get its source from git://github.com/ershad/Mutt-Gmail-Conf.git    Good luck :)</p>
