<p>A couple of weeks before, We (Anivar, Manoj and me) had a meetup with Sri K. H. Hussain who is a pioneer in library science. He has worked in many projects including earlier version of Grandham (Malayalagrandham.com) and has been a member of its task force. He offered guidance for development and his inspiring vision for this project helped us to fix the goals.</p>
<p><em>(The trip for the meetup was fun. Though it was for Google 'Summer' of Code, we got drenched in the heavy monsoon of Kerala ;))</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Meanwhile the coding period for GSoC had started, It was time to fasten the development process and get the project up as fast as possible. I had drawn few design mockups and have started implementing them.</span></p>

<p>Most of these designs are just helpers to assist in development to get the backend and features done. We will do proper styling and UX enhancements after implementing the backend.</p>
<p>Currently the application has the following features,</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Basic books listing and API</span></li>
<li>Bootswatch integration</li>
<li>Dynamic URLs in Navbar according to the language selected</li>
<li>Add book form</li>
<li>Edit book (which would save the data as as a new revision)</li>
<li>Decent test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Live instance of the application in development is running here -Â <a href="http://grandham.herokuapp.com">grandham.herokuapp.com</a></p>
<p>Regarding the representation of binary MARC21 data in relational database, we had decided to convert it to MARCXML and then it shouldn't be a problem to store. It needs a bit more research on how many attributes and data fields it would take to completely express MARC data, hoping to write a separate post on that later.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Happy hacking, folks!</p>
