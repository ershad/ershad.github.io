<p>Last week, I worked on edit book feature and design mockups.</p>
<p><strong>Edit book feature</strong></p>
<p>As you know from previous posts, we have Submission model to store every contribution from users. When an user submits a correction or an edit, it gets stored as a new Submission in submissions table which needs approval from task force to live. 'Edit' component of this feature was implented last week.</p>
<p>We have a few routes associated with this feature.</p>
<p>The following route is to post details for adding a new book. It requires language_id (language short code such as ML or EN) to associate the book to that language. Grandham creates new Submission and a new Book instance (with auto generated grandham_id) if submission to this route was successful.</p>
<pre> POST language_submissions_path - /language/:language_id/submissions</pre>
<p>Next route is the edit book feature's route. It requires book_id (grandham_id of the book) to accept information. It creates just a new Submission for the exising book. This submission will be available for task force to approve.</p>
<pre> POST book_submissions_path - /books/:book_id/submissions</pre>
<p><strong>Design mockups</strong></p>
<p>Like I mentioned in <a title="GSoC 2013: Updates on Grandham project" href="http://ershadk.com/blog/2013/07/14/grandham-update-2/">one of my previous posts</a>, I had drawn the design mockups for basic features of Grandham. The application will be in a state to go live when the features in design mockups are done.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>We now have a live instance of app running in Heroku - <a href="http://grandham.herokuapp.com">grandham.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>
