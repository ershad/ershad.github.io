<p>This week I've been mostly fixing bugs, refactoring code and building admin features. Grandham has built in checks to avoid duplication in Authors/Publishers now.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Review Interface</strong> <a href="http://ershadk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Grandham-review-page.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-738" alt="Grandham review page" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Grandham-review-page-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>We have a new interface this week -  A screen to review <em>crowdsourced </em>information submissions. Administrators can use this feature to control the information displayed to user. Currently every review item has 3 actions - Approve, Archive or Comment. Out of these, 'Comment' is a new feature which needs to be implemented. It will be helpful for the task force to generate discussions around specific submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>After a couple of rounds of refactoring, Grandham got a <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/smc/grandham/trends">Code Climate score</a> of 4.0 from 1.61! :)</p>
