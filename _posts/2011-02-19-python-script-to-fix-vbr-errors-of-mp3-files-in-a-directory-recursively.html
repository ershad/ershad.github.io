<p>If the seek bar of your rhythmbox is not working with some mp3 files, it might be an issue with Variable Bit Rate of them. The tool, 'vbrfix' written by William Pye solves the issue, but the problem is that it doesn't have an option to search for files recursively. Here is a small python script that gets the paths of multiple mp3 files recursively and give them as arguments to vbrfix tool. Make sure you install vbrfix (from the software repo) before running the script.</p>
<p>Please see comments for a better, 1 line substitute to do the same. Thanks to Rajeesh ettan and Syam ettan :)</p>
