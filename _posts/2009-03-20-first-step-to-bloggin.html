<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>      For the past few days, i was searching for a good reason to write a blog. On my way, i met some nice friends and their blogs helped me a lot. You must know some facts before reading my articles, that is i'm niether good at english nor experienced at blogging but i can't sit idle.</p>
<p> You might have wondered why i selected a name " syntax" for this blog (if not, please wonder), that is because i need a name related to computers but the words like "hack","hack log" etc. are already taken by my above mentioned friends x-( . But there also  i don't have a mind to give up, i chose "syntax",which has  no meaning in this context but it seems heavier than other words !! . So this is a start and i expect your co-operation and motivation. Thanks to all. Best wishes...</p>
