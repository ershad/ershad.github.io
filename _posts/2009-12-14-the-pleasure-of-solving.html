<p>It's been a quite long since I blogged something :) May be a writer's block* (*acronym for pure laziness,here);) Well, Last Saturday, I went to dxmk9 program conducted by NSS collage of engineering at Kottamaidhanam, Palakkad. I had registered my name for 'Geek's Paradise' competition which is basically a C programming contest. The first task was to answer some objective questions, mainly to predict the output, was not much tough. The second task was to print a number pattern like this:</p>
<p>1<br />
1 2 1<br />
1 2 3 2 1<br />
1 2 3 4 3 2 1<br />
1 2 3 2 1<br />
1 2 1<br />
1</p>
<p>whooo! the problem was not easy for a newbie like me ('m still in school,sir ;) ), I simply wrote some printf() statements with some ++i,etc. and escaped! Also, I had no much time to think, I had promised to return home before 1 PM.</p>
<p>When I reached home, a sudden thought flashed across my mind "Why shouldn't I give a try ?". I booted my ubuntu system ( 'm eagerly waiting to get Fedora in hands), took newly installed Netbeans IDE and started trying. After some time -Â  LOL :) !! It worked!! The program asked for an integer input and printed the pattern exactly the way it's meant to be! I know, this is a small problem and has nothing of great speciality or something, but don't know why - The output gave me some moments of rejoice! A small pleasure of coding :) Ha ha, I would like to share that code with you :)</p>
