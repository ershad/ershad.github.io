<p>I couldn't post the weekly updates regularly for the last two times since I was kept more busy than I had expected and the festive holiday that came in between. Here's a quick review of what happened during the 7th week of GSoC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grandham got an UI revamp!</li>
<li>Integrated new <a href="bootswatch.com/readable/">theme</a>.</li>
<li>Separate books / authors / publishers lists were implemented</li>
<li>Updated user sign in / sign up pages</li>
<li>Integrated database clear and fixed failing specs (It's green now, yay!)</li>
</ul>
