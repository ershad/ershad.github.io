<p>Some of my friends always complain that they are not able download packages due to Internet availability issues or usage limit. Most of them are using different Ubuntu versions, hence I cannot use APTonCD to download the packages for them. Here's a small solution for this, Thanks to ilug-tvm and Rajeesh ettan.</p>
<p>Step 1: Get the download URLs in a file :</p>
<p>Execute the following command replacing <code>package-names</code> with required ones, separating by a space.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$apt-get -y install --print-uris package-name | cut -d' -f2 | grep http:// &gt; apturls</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Step 2: Copy this file (apturls) to a machine which has high-speed Internet access, and execute the following command to download the packages:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$wget -i path-to-apturls-file </code></p></blockquote>
<p>Step 3: Now get those downloaded packages to your machine, and install them using :</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$cd path-to-the-downloaded-packages-directory</code></p>
<p>$sudo dpkg -i *.deb</p></blockquote>
<p>Done!</p>
<p>Thank you, Good Luck :)</p>
