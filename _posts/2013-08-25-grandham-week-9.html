<p>In Week 9, I rewrote the complete crowdsourcing functionality of Grandham from a submission based approach to micro-edits based approach. Earlier we used to store the entire snapshot while recording modifications but now we store only the 'edit' (similar to diff, but in a structured database table) and pass it to admins for reviewing. This approach has some significant advantages including the easy generation of history of book pages.</p>
<p>In-place editing was integrated during the same week. Now participants can click on a field and edit it.</p>
