<p>Yesterday, I went to <a href="http://mesce.ac.in" target="_blank">MES College of Engineering</a> to deliver a small talk on programming and free software, it was entirely a new experience for me. A bigger crowd than expected was present. It went fine :) Thanks to <a href="http://raghesh.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Raghesh sir</a>, Raju sir, S@IT and to friends there :)</p>
<p>I'm happy to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ershadk/programming-is-fun-an-intro-to-free-software" target="_blank">share my little slides</a>. It was created according to numerous suggestions by Raghesh sir. For fun, the presentation was started with a SMS trigger from audience :) The code for that is like 'get-thing-done' and doesn't have the quality to upload. It's developed using python with gammu module. Please feel free to tell me if you want to have a look at the code.</p>

<p>Thank you :)</p>
