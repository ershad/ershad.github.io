<p style="text-align: left;">Last weekly I mainly worked on Search feature and admin interfaces. Here's a quick review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimented with various search engines like Sphinx, Ferret, etc and finally decided to use <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>Â with <a href="https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot">sunspot</a> gem as it worked well with unicorn data without any configuration.</li>
<li>Wrote a general search backend interface for Grandham. We can plugin other search engines anytime as long as it communicated the way Grandham needs it.</li>
<li>Added Admin interfaces managing Authors and Publishers.</li>
</ul>
