<p>Hi, Here's a small anagram solver written in C. It works based on generating permutations of given string and comparing them using a dictionary. For fast search in dictionary, the program first creates an index of the starting location of each alphabet. It takes a few minutes to process long words.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ershad/Snippets/blob/master/anagramSolver.c" target="_blank">Here's the source code</a>. Suggestions are always welcome, Greetings :)</p>
<p>Update: There's a little problem in using the term 'anagram solver' here. An anagram solver finds words from another valid word - But this program finds words from the characters of given valid/invalid word.Â  Thanks to <a href="http://technikhil.wordpress.com">technikhil</a> for the info :)</p>
<p>Note: Realized that this implementation of anagram solver is inefficient. Will post a better one soon.</p>
