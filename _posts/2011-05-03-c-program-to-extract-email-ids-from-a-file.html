<p>Here's a small program to extract email IDs from an input file. It could have done using regex (in Python orÂ  in any other high level language), but doing it in C is more fun, eh? :)</p>
<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/ershad/Snippets/blob/master/parseEmail.c" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
<p>Usage: parseEmail [FILE]</p>
<p>Suggestions and improvements are always welcome :) Thank you!</p>
