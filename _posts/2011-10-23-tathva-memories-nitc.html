<p><em>".. I'm leaving this campus today. I will miss the late-night hangouts with <a href="http://k4rtik.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kartik</a> and Pankaj.. I will miss the stay in Kartik's room with Arjun and Rohit (If you are reading this, All the best for your IAS, brother). I will miss Ramnath, Arnab and all my  friends here and this great institution.. I'm sure I will be back here for the next event.. With a million beautiful memories in 4 days.. Adieu NITC.."</em></p>
