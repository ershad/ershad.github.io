This page lists some of my security bug findings.

**1. GitHub**

Found a [security bug](https://bounty.github.com/researchers/ershad.html) related to forked private GitHub gists and was awarded a bounty for it.

**2. Prezi**

Found a vulnerability using which we could retrieve titles of private presentations of other users. Prezi awarded me a bounty for that finding.
