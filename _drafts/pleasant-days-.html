<p>I like this evening, my friend has promised, he would reach here by 5. Brother is busy with his studies, and everybody here has their own works. I have been thinking of doing something creative for a past few days, but not getting much concentration. Everyone says Getting hardly two free afternoons a week - not even sufficient to do school's+entrance works. But, I like these days.. They are pleasant and refreshing.. Every day starts with something new, every second has something to tell</p>
<p>and   i  have passed to +2 this year with a decent amount of marks, also decided to write improvement to score around 5% more to attain above 90%.</p>
