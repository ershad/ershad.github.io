<p>For the past few weeks, I was totally detached from the online world. GPRS is not much economical I had never been to online for days, exams are assignments were suffocating us. are at full throttleÂ  areand friends who have internet at home got serious at once in studies and they were more interested in group studies and completing assignments.</p>

<p>My english has gone worse, becoming more serious about grammer - is that what the people call 'mental change in teenage' ??</p>
