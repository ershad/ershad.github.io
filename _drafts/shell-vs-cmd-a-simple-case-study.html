<p>Haven't you ever heard someone saying "GNU/Linux is the Develper's OS" ? (don't say no, you heard it at least now !). But, is it like that ? How come a free software can defeat propriety software in the very important sector "Development" ? Big software company invest HUGE amounts for software development and to build developing tools, then what is the role of free software in development ? Quite confused like me ? Well, i decided to check it ;)</p>
<p>Though i can't build huge applications and tools for testing efficiency in both the free and propriety platforms, it's possible to create a small C++ program to perform some-what complex mathematical operations and displaying them in monitor. Such a program has been made and tested it in both GNU/Linux platform and WINDOW$ platform and the result was AMAZING !!. Here it is...</p>
<p><strong>Experiment Desk :</strong> P4 2.6GHz Processor, 1.2 GB RAM, ATI on-board Graphics</p>
<p><strong>Testing Tool :</strong> A 32 bit C++ program compiled with g++. This program allocates 80000 floats, 10000 X 50 + 1 chars &amp; 4 ints on initial execution. Then it fills 60000  blocks with data ranging from 1 to 49 and generates 10000 names from 5-alphabets combination which will be stored in memory. Next step is to calculate individual sum, individual average and subject wise average of 10000 students with 6 Subjects. Last task is to display all these data as a table on monitor. <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/syntaxclub/sdpp" target="_blank">Click here for the source code</a></p>
<p><em>The experiment begins...</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Task 1 : Estimate the time to for complete execution</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>GNU/Linux ( ubuntu 8.04 )</strong></p>
<p>Well, I decided to check it with simple tasks and experiments. The tool is a C++ program developed with Dev C++,</p>
