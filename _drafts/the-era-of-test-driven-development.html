<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a> is a popular software development process in which tests are written before writing code unlike the conventional development method where software is tested after programming. I believe most of the future software development will be following this methodology and it's necessary that we should get familiar with it.</p>
